# Projest Ideas List

1. Try get an [Open EIT](https://www.opensourceimaging.org/project/open-eit-electrical-impedance-tomography/) kit and see if I can increase its resolution by sourcing and sinking current from sensors to build a 3D map of the sensor locations.

2. Fix up the kids solar powered mud kitchen pump with an ESP32 S2 to monitor battery health and prevent pumps from running too long. (Done)

3. Power sensors for Leaf and HWS. (Leaf done, HWS pending)

4. Document water tank level sensor using load cells.

5. [Get Panasonic heat pump conected to an ESP](https://github.com/leon-v/Panasonic-CN-CNT-ESPHome)
